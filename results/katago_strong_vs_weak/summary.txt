Observations:
1. Weak model frequently over-extends in early opening fights, especially in corners.
2. Strong model shows clear superiority in life-and-death judgment and whole-board balance.
3. In most games, strong model secures territory advantage by move 120–150.
4. Two weak-model wins occurred due to:
   - an early capturing race mis-evaluation by the strong model (Game 7)
   - an unstable ladder-reading position (Game 14)
5. Differences between both versions are very useful for teaching:
   - opening shape quality
   - mid-game influence control
   - endgame precision
